# Django_Web_Application

I have created a basic web application using Django Form that takes the following values from user and insert into dbsqlite.

i) Author
ii) Title
iii) Description
iv) Published Date is submitted automatically as the user enter the details on the given form.

To implement this, I have used Django, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Ajax.

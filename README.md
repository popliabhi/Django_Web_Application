# Django_Web_Application

I have created a basic web application using Django Form that takes the following values from user and insert into dbsqlite.<br />
<br />

i) Author<br />
ii) Title<br />
iii) Description<br />
iv) Published Date is submitted automatically as the user enter the details on the given form.<br />

To implement this, I have used Django, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Ajax.
